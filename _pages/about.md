## About Me
I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, where I have the pleasure of being advised by [Professor Hajiaghayi](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/).

My research interests are broadly within the field of theoretical computer science, with a specific focus on approximation algorithms for graph problems.
